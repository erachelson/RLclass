MCTS and AlphaZero have been both famous for their results at the Go Game. Notably, AlphaZero beat the world best Go Player which was thought for decades as one of the challenges AI would never address. Recent versions of the algorithm demonstrated astonishing results. The same AlphaZero algorithm, with the same hyperparameters, might be trained from scratch to beat the best chess software (StockFish) in 3hrs and to beat best players at Go in a little bit less than 10hrs."

    "While both algorithms have been largely used for two players games, they might be adapted to address one player games, i.e. standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Recently, MuZero, a model-based version of AlphaZero, was shown to beat all standard Deep RL algorithms on Atari games. In this notebook, we will developp a one-player version of both algorithms, MCTS and AlphaZero. In this first time, we will make it work on the simple CartPole environmment and then, once the algorithm is functionnal, we will test it on the game FlappyBird."

We also store in the node the reward $r_1$ that we obtained. The goal is to construct a tree to explore in a smart way the action-state space to find a sequence of actions, from the initial state $s_0$, that maximize the sum of rewards obtained."

    "When an MCTS node is created, we create three arrays: one containing the number of visits of its potential children, one containing the Q-values of its potential children and one containing priors over its potential children. All arrays have a size that equals the number of actions available in the environment. We initialize them to 0. The Q-value of a node estimates the averaged sum of reward obtained from its parent node when the action that leads to this node has been chosen. The prior of a node is a prior of the probability for the action that leads to this node to be chosen from its parent node. In standard MCTS, we don't have access to meaningful priors, thus we set them all to 1/number of actions. However, these priors will have an important role when using AlphaZero.\n",

    "<b>Node selection:</b> Starting from a node $s_t$, we select a next node to visit with a criteria that uses the node prior and Q-value estimations. We may define several different criterias. When a node is selected we instanciate the corresponding python object and store it has one of the children of the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Value and priors estimation:</b> When a node is selected we estimate priors over its potential children as well as the V-value of this node. As said, in standard MCTS, we always compute the priors as one over the number of actions. The V-Value corresponds to the averaged sum of rewards obtained from this node. In standard MCTS, to estimate it, we simply perform one or several random rollouts from this node and compute the mean of the sum of rewards encountered. Note that this estimation has a very high variance which is good for epxloration but also decrease significantly the search speed and accuracy. AlphaZero notably proposes a better alternative to estimate this value. If the node is final, i.e. correspond to the end of an episode, we estimate the value as the final reward obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Value backup:</b> Once the node V-Value $v$ has been estimated, we backpropagate this value in the tree up to the root-node to update along the path all the nodes Q-values. Note that is the version of the algorithm we propose in this course, we discount the sum of rewards by a factor $\\gamma$. Thus both the V-value and the Q-value computed estimate a discounted sum of rewards. During the backup, we also update the nodes visit counts $N$."

A first and simple way to define a value target is to take the sum (or the discounted sum in our case) of the rewards encountered during the episode. This is the strategy used in the original AlphaZero. This strategy is commonly called Monte Carlo estimation. In this notebook, we will use an n-steps target as described in the [MuZero paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265).

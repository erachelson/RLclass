    "\n",
    "Ok, so given a policy, we have a way (two actually) to compute its value function. Now we would like to find the optimal policy and we'd rather not enumerate all possible policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce some notations and start with two trivial remarks. We write:\n",
    "$$V^{\\pi^*} = V^*, \\quad Q^{\\pi^*} = Q^*$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can note that:\n",
    "1. $Q^*\\left(s,a\\right) = r\\left(s,a\\right) + \\gamma \\sum\\limits_{s'\\in S}p\\left(s'|s,a\\right) V^*\\left(s'\\right)$\n",
    "2. If $\\pi^*$ is an optimal policy, then $V^*\\left(s\\right) = Q^*\\left(s,\\pi^*\\left(s\\right)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the first remark, we note that the maximum expected return one can get from a trajectory initiated in $s$ starts with the action $a$ that maximizes $Q^*(s,a)$. So:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert-success\">**Optimal greedy policy**<br>\n",
    "Any policy $\\pi$ defined by $\\pi(s) \\in \\arg\\max\\limits_{a\\in A} Q^*(s,a)$ is an optimal policy.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, finding $\\pi^*$ is equivalent to finding $Q^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes the key theorem of this class:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert-success\">**Bellman optimality equation**<br>\n",
    "The optimal value function obeys:\n",
    "$$V^*(s) = \\max\\limits_{a\\in A} \\left\\{ r(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum\\limits_{s'\\in S} p(s'|s,a) V^*(s') \\right\\}=(T^* V^*) (s)$$\n",
    "or in terms of $Q$-functions:\n",
    "$$Q^*(s,a) = r(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum\\limits_{s'\\in S}p(s'|s,a) \\max\\limits_{a'\\in A} Q^*(s',a')=(T^* Q^*) (s,a)$$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does that unfold intuitively from the previous remarks? Simply because of the Dynamic Programming principle: any subpath of an optimal path is itself optimal. That might still sound obscure. So let's say that if you start a trajectory in $s$ and if you know you will get the maximum value from any state $s'$ you reach, then the maximum value you can get from $s$ is precisely $\\max\\limits_{a\\in A} \\left\\{ r(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum\\limits_{s'\\in S} p(s'|s,a) V^*(s') \\right\\}$. The actual proof is quite trickier but the key ideas are here.<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert-success\">**Properties of $T^*$**<br>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> $T^\\pi$ is non-linear.<br>\n",
    "<li> With $\\gamma<1$, $T^*$ is a $\\| \\cdot \\|_\\infty$-contraction mapping over the $\\mathcal{F}(S,\\mathbb{R})$ (resp. $\\mathcal{F}(S\\times A,\\mathbb{R})$) Banach space.<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert-warning\">**Exercice**<br>\n",

    "So we have seen quite a lot of things about MDPs and how to find optimal policies for them. That would be helpful if we always knew the MDP model underlying the control problem we wish to solve, but in most cases, we have no idea of the transition probabilities or the reward model. If you are playing FrozenLake for the first time for example, you will have to try different actions to get a sense of the transition model. Moreover, this class is called *Reinforcement Learning* and we haven't seen much learning yet.\n",
